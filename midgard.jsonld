    "title": "Withdraw ₳2,162,096 for Midgard - Optimistic Rollups administered by Intersect\n\n",
    "abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Midgard - Optimistic Rollups** which will provide the following services: Midgard, which is a modular framework for deploying optimistic rollup Layer 2s on the Cardano blockchain, designed to enhance transaction throughput, reduce costs, and enable advanced decentralized applications.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.\n\n",
    "motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nWe have Hydra as our native state of the art state channel solution, we have\n\npartnerchains as our native evolution of sidechains, Midgard aims to be our native\n\nevolution of rollups.\n\nThe UTxO system is a match made in heaven for rollups. It allows us to build true L2\n\nrollups that inherit maximal security from Cardano. This cannot be replicated in account\n\nbased systems. It's not a coincidence that Fuel, the first general purpose L2 to receive a\n\ndecentralization rating of stage 2 (highest possible) is UTxO based.\n\nFraud proofs for global state systems like Arbitrum and Optimism are extremely\n\ndifficult to implement and very expensive and complicated to conduct onchain (and\n\nrequire multiple parties);this is why to this date despite spending millions in R&D neither\n\nof those protocols has working fraud proofs, and they all rely on centralized\n\npermissioned sequencers and operators.\n\nOn the other-hand, fraud proofs on Cardano are extremely straightforward and\n\nrequire only a single party (no challenge-response proofs) due to the local state\n\nproperties of the ledger.\n\nNot a single blockchain has managed to achieve true permissionless general purpose\n\nrollups. At the end of the day, the top \"L2s\"in the blockchain space right now are all\n\ncustodial multisigs. The Midgard framework is a first of its kind, in its capabilities to\n\ndeploy completely permissionless rollups that inherit the full security of Cardano.\n\n- No centralized sequencer\n\n- No challenge response \"proofs\"\n\n- No custodial multisig\n\n- Permissionless fraud proofs (open to anyone)\n\n- Permissionless operator set\n\n- Deposits and withdrawals cannot be censored (inherits the full censorship resistance of Cardano)\n\nThis is all made possible by Cardano's unique local state EUTxO architecture.\n\nUTxO contention, small block size, local state, transaction determinism, all of these\n\n\"problems\" may have led you to question why these design choices were made.\n\nMidgard aims to show you that these are actually not problems at all. In-fact quite the\n\nopposite, they are extremely powerful properties that, together, provide unique value\n\nthat simply does not exist in any other ecosystem. These are, in actuality, the core pillars\n\nthat make Midgard even possible in the first place.\n\nYou cannot build Midgard on Ethereum, Solana or Sui. It is a protocol that is only possible\n\non Cardano.\n\n",
    "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nMidgard has a tokenless design. All transaction fees on Midgard are paid in Ada, and every Midgard block is published to the Cardano L1. Where Hydra moves transactions offchain (and thus does not contribute consistently in fee revenue to the Cardano L1) Midgard keeps transactions on-chain but in a more compact form (ie. rolls up transactions offchain into a compact representation that is published on-chain, thus the name rollups). This means that increased economic activity on Midgard directly translated to increased economic activity on Cardano, this represents a significant source of fee revenue for the Cardano L1. Midgard does not have independent consensus or economic security, instead it inherits economic security and consensus from Cardano.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nAnastasia Labs is at the forefront of research & development on Cardano for over two years now. We have been involved in the development of nearly every large dApp on Cardano. We have made contributions to many of the core repos, and we actively maintain over 50 different open-source libraries, tools, and public infrastructure for Cardano.\n\nYou can read more about our work here:\n\n[[https://www.anastasialabs.com/]{.mark}](https://www.anastasialabs.com/)\n\nFurthermore, Midgard is already in active development, and we have already made significant progress towards our goal of EOY mainnet readiness.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest\n\nmilestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen described **{to-do once done}.**\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), governed by one Oversight Committee, with many Project-Specific Smart Contract (PSSC). This Oversight Committee consists of Intersect and five independent trusted entities.\n\nThe Oversight Committee will consist of three Intersect 'admin', two Intersect 'leadership' and then five independent trusted entities. These trusted entities will be Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see **[Smart Contract Guide**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Prbm1mtkwSsGWSvG1Bfd/s/ifmTlBp95tW0JEo9KcL6/) on knowledgebase.\n\nThe highlevel permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. The TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nReferences\n\nMidgard Project Scope (PDF)\n\n- ipfs://bafybeicct27qnakhth7bfsysv6j2mmcfmykfnz7cunagwxftsocekjve6m\n\nProject Proposal In Ekklesia\n\n- [https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d276](https://2025budget.intersectmbo.org/ballots/680d1b63565577986442d123/proposals/680d1b64565577986442d276)\n\nApproved Budget Info Action submitted by Intersect\n\n- [https://gov.tools/governance_actions/e14de8d9dc4f4ddf3fe9250a8a926e20f10e99b86bd0610b77d7a054981591ee#0](https://gov.tools/governance_actions/e14de8d9dc4f4ddf3fe9250a8a926e20f10e99b86bd0610b77d7a054981591ee#0)\n\nDetails of all successful proposals (CSV)\n\n- ipfs://bafybeicwrop4q7xvnyjdd5drumbe56sqtm5lbe2ul3c262zt4hgguzdycm\n\nSmart Contract Guide (Update to blogpost when published)\n\n- [Smart Contracts as part of Intersects Administration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17mblZTepHKQuzRDR_nSNZkIU6MkLpKHvajkizeEgsmY/edit?tab=t.0)\n\nAuthors\n\n",
